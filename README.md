# FacebookCrawler
Web crawler to get number of likes and people observing specific facebook pages

1. Update email credentials
2. Update list-of-websites-to-crawl.txt with pages to crawl (works only on "/likes" because of divs naming convention within FB) e.g.:


url:https://www.facebook.com/beugieaone/likes <- url to crawl

website-name:BEUGIEA <- name that will be presented in excel spreadsheet
